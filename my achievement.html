   My name is olabode victor ayorinde,i here by want to discuss about my achivement right from the begining of my life till date.<br>
less i proceed i will like to briefly describe the word achievement.<br> Achievement can simply explain as what someone or somebody has done successfully in his/her
life especially using his own personal effort/capability.<br>
This reminds me of those days when i was in nusary/primaary school (ANSARU-DEEN ISLAMIC NUSARY AND PRIMARY SCHOOL), there is that paticular girl that we always compete together to become leader of that great school
but fortunate enough, when i was in primary (5) second and third term i came out with 1st position out 50 students, due to this success i was priviledge to become their senior prefect in around (2010/11). This same year i seated for an entrance exam to junior secondary school God so good i passed this exam and became secondary school student immediatly.<p>
While geting to secondary school(ALLA GRAMMAR SCHOOL ALLA), i met different students from different primary schools, i wrote my first exam and came out with 4th position out of nomerous number of students.However, i register for junior waec i read very hard during this period of preparing,
God so good i seated for the exam and had excellent reasult, this made me to become senior secondary school student.<br>
My first year in (sss) classes was so amazing and wonderful because out of up to 18 to 20 subject i had 15 excellents, in sss2 our class was devided into different department where i was luckly found myself in science department.
In short, during my sss3 in this school i was served as their senior prefect also.I wrote my ssce and passed.<br>
Troughtout my secondary i dont ever have ambition to further my education talkless of coming to(kwasu) but God always did his things in mysterious ways.<p>
In around 2018 after stayed home for good two to three years or helping brother to hoe together on his because isa very popular farmer in ondo state wherehe has very big plants plantations.<br>
I bought jamb form in ilorin at one of jamb branch, without wasting much of our time, i seated for this exam and passed. due to that success i have to proceed by applying for kwasu admition, ii was admited, recently i am now lucky student of kwara state university, malete, department of library and information science.<p>
